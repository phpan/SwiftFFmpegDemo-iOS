    /// for planar, set the start point of each channel's data within the buffer,
    /// for packed, set the start point of the entire buffer only.
    ///
    /// The value pointed to by linesize is set to the aligned size of each channel's data buffer for
    /// planar layout, or to the aligned size of the buffer for all channels for packed layout.

    /// The buffer in buf must be big enough to contain all the samples (use `AVSample.getBufferSize` to
    /// compute its minimum size), otherwise the data pointers will point to invalid data.

    ///   - channelCount: the number of channels

    ///   - sampleFmt: the sample format
    ///   - align: buffer size alignment (0 = default, 1 = no alignment)
    /// - Returns:  the size in bytes required for the audio buffer, a negative error code in case of failure
